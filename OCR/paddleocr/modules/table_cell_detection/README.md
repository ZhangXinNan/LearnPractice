# I. Overview

The Table Cell Detection Module is a key component of the table recognition task, responsible for locating and marking each cell region in table images. The performance of this module directly affects the accuracy and efficiency of the entire table recognition process. The Table Cell Detection Module typically outputs bounding boxes for each cell region, which are then passed as input to the table recognition pipeline for further processing.
