# 1. Overview

Multimodal chart parsing is a cutting-edge OCR technology that focuses on automatically converting various types of visual charts (such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, etc.) into structured data tables with formatted output. Traditional methods rely on complex pipeline designs with chart keypoint detection models, which involve many prior assumptions and tend to lack robustness. The models in this module leverage the latest VLM (Vision-Language Model) techniques and are data-driven, learning robust features from vast real-world datasets. Application scenarios include financial analysis, academic research, business reporting, and more—for instance, quickly extracting growth trend data from financial reports, experimental comparison figures from research papers, or user distribution statistics from market surveys—empowering users to transition from “viewing charts” to “using data”.
