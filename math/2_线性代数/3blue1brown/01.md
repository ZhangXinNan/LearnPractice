# 01 Vectors, What even are they?
The physics student perspective is that vectors are arrows pointing in space. What defines a given vector is its length, and the direction it's pointing. But as long as two facts are the same, you can move it around and it's still the same vector.
The computer science student perspective is that vectors are ordered lists of numbers.
The mathematician seeks to generalize both of these views, basically saying a vector can be anything. where there's a sensible notion of adding two vectors and multiplying a vector by a number.
