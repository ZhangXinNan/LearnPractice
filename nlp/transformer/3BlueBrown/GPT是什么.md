The initials GPT stand for Generative Pre-trained Transformer.
Generative: So that first word is straightforward enough, these are bots that generate new text.
Pre-trained: Pretrained refers to how the model went through a process of learning from a massive amount of data, and the prefix insinuates that there's more room to fine-tune it on specific tasks with additional training.
Transformer: But the last word, that's the real key piece. A transformer is a specific kind of neural network, a machine learning model, and it's the core invention underlying the current boom in AI.
