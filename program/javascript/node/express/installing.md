```bash
mkdir myapp
cd myapp
```

Use the `npm init` command to create a `package.json` file for your application. For more information on how `package.json` works, see Specifics of npmâ€™s package.json handling.
```bash
npm init
```

This command prompts you for a number of things, such as the name and version of your application. For now, you can simply hit RETURN to accept the defaults for most of them, with the following exception:
```bash
entry point: (index.js)
```

Enter app.js, or whatever you want the name of the main file to be. If you want it to be index.js, hit RETURN to accept the suggested default file name.

Now, install Express in the myapp directory and save it in the dependencies list. For example:
```bash
npm install express
```
To install Express temporarily and not add it to the dependencies list:
```bash
npm install express --no-save
```
