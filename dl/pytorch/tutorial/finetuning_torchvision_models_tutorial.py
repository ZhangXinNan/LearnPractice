######################################################################
# In this tutorial we will take a deeper look at how to finetune and
# feature extract the `torchvision
# models <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html>`__, all
# of which have been pretrained on the 1000-class Imagenet dataset. This
# tutorial will give an indepth look at how to work with several modern
# CNN architectures, and will build an intuition for finetuning any
# PyTorch model. Since each model architecture is different, there is no
# boilerplate finetuning code that will work in all scenarios. Rather, the
# researcher must look at the existing architecture and make custom
# adjustments for each model.
# 
# In this document we will perform two types of transfer learning:
# finetuning and feature extraction. In **finetuning**, we start with a
# pretrained model and update *all* of the model’s parameters for our new
# task, in essence retraining the whole model. In **feature extraction**,
# we start with a pretrained model and only update the final layer weights
# from which we derive predictions. It is called feature extraction
# because we use the pretrained CNN as a fixed feature-extractor, and only
# change the output layer. For more technical information about transfer
# learning see `here <https://cs231n.github.io/transfer-learning/>`__ and
# `here <https://ruder.io/transfer-learning/>`__.
# 
# In general both transfer learning methods follow the same few steps:
# 
# -  Initialize the pretrained model
# -  Reshape the final layer(s) to have the same number of outputs as the
#    number of classes in the new dataset
# -  Define for the optimization algorithm which parameters we want to
#    update during training
# -  Run the training step

# Inputs
# ------
# 
# Here are all of the parameters to change for the run. We will use the
# *hymenoptera_data* dataset which can be downloaded
# `here <https://download.pytorch.org/tutorial/hymenoptera_data.zip>`__.
# This dataset contains two classes, **bees** and **ants**, and is
# structured such that we can use the
# `ImageFolder <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/datasets.html#torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder>`__
# dataset, rather than writing our own custom dataset. Download the data
# and set the ``data_dir`` input to the root directory of the dataset. The
# ``model_name`` input is the name of the model you wish to use and must
# be selected from this list:
# 
# ::
# 
#    [resnet, alexnet, vgg, squeezenet, densenet, inception]
# 
# The other inputs are as follows: ``num_classes`` is the number of
# classes in the dataset, ``batch_size`` is the batch size used for
# training and may be adjusted according to the capability of your
# machine, ``num_epochs`` is the number of training epochs we want to run,
# and ``feature_extract`` is a boolean that defines if we are finetuning
# or feature extracting. If ``feature_extract = False``, the model is
# finetuned and all model parameters are updated. If
# ``feature_extract = True``, only the last layer parameters are updated,
# the others remain fixed.
# 

# Top level data directory. Here we assume the format of the directory conforms 
#   to the ImageFolder structure
data_dir = "./data/hymenoptera_data"

# Models to choose from [resnet, alexnet, vgg, squeezenet, densenet, inception]
model_name = "squeezenet"

# Number of classes in the dataset
num_classes = 2

# Batch size for training (change depending on how much memory you have)
batch_size = 8

# Number of epochs to train for 
num_epochs = 15

# Flag for feature extracting. When False, we finetune the whole model, 
#   when True we only update the reshaped layer params
feature_extract = True

# Helper Functions
# ----------------
# 
# Before we write the code for adjusting the models, lets define a few
# helper functions.
# 
# Model Training and Validation Code
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# The ``train_model`` function handles the training and validation of a
# given model. As input, it takes a PyTorch model, a dictionary of
# dataloaders, a loss function, an optimizer, a specified number of epochs
# to train and validate for, and a boolean flag for when the model is an
# Inception model. The *is_inception* flag is used to accomodate the
# *Inception v3* model, as that architecture uses an auxiliary output and
# the overall model loss respects both the auxiliary output and the final
# output, as described
# `here <https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/how-to-optimize-inception-model-with-auxiliary-classifiers/7958>`__.
# The function trains for the specified number of epochs and after each
# epoch runs a full validation step. It also keeps track of the best
# performing model (in terms of validation accuracy), and at the end of
# training returns the best performing model. After each epoch, the
# training and validation accuracies are printed.
#

######################################################################
# Set Model Parameters’ .requires_grad attribute
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# This helper function sets the ``.requires_grad`` attribute of the
# parameters in the model to False when we are feature extracting. By
# default, when we load a pretrained model all of the parameters have
# ``.requires_grad=True``, which is fine if we are training from scratch
# or finetuning. However, if we are feature extracting and only want to
# compute gradients for the newly initialized layer then we want all of
# the other parameters to not require gradients. This will make more sense
# later.
# 

def set_parameter_requires_grad(model, feature_extracting):
    if feature_extracting:
        for param in model.parameters():
            param.requires_grad = False


######################################################################
# Initialize and Reshape the Networks
# -----------------------------------
# 
# Now to the most interesting part. Here is where we handle the reshaping
# of each network. Note, this is not an automatic procedure and is unique
# to each model. Recall, the final layer of a CNN model, which is often
# times an FC layer, has the same number of nodes as the number of output
# classes in the dataset. Since all of the models have been pretrained on
# Imagenet, they all have output layers of size 1000, one node for each
# class. The goal here is to reshape the last layer to have the same
# number of inputs as before, AND to have the same number of outputs as
# the number of classes in the dataset. In the following sections we will
# discuss how to alter the architecture of each model individually. But
# first, there is one important detail regarding the difference between
# finetuning and feature-extraction.
# 
# When feature extracting, we only want to update the parameters of the
# last layer, or in other words, we only want to update the parameters for
# the layer(s) we are reshaping. Therefore, we do not need to compute the
# gradients of the parameters that we are not changing, so for efficiency
# we set the .requires_grad attribute to False. This is important because
# by default, this attribute is set to True. Then, when we initialize the
# new layer and by default the new parameters have ``.requires_grad=True``
# so only the new layer’s parameters will be updated. When we are
# finetuning we can leave all of the .required_grad’s set to the default
# of True.
# 
# Finally, notice that inception_v3 requires the input size to be
# (299,299), whereas all of the other models expect (224,224).
# 
# Resnet
# ~~~~~~
# 
# Resnet was introduced in the paper `Deep Residual Learning for Image
# Recognition <https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385>`__. There are several
# variants of different sizes, including Resnet18, Resnet34, Resnet50,
# Resnet101, and Resnet152, all of which are available from torchvision
# models. Here we use Resnet18, as our dataset is small and only has two
# classes. When we print the model, we see that the last layer is a fully
# connected layer as shown below:
# 
# ::
# 
#    (fc): Linear(in_features=512, out_features=1000, bias=True) 
# 
# Thus, we must reinitialize ``model.fc`` to be a Linear layer with 512
# input features and 2 output features with:
# 
# ::
# 
#    model.fc = nn.Linear(512, num_classes)
# 
# Alexnet
# ~~~~~~~
# 
# Alexnet was introduced in the paper `ImageNet Classification with Deep
# Convolutional Neural
# Networks <https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf>`__
# and was the first very successful CNN on the ImageNet dataset. When we
# print the model architecture, we see the model output comes from the 6th
# layer of the classifier
# 
# ::
# 
#    (classifier): Sequential(
#        ...
#        (6): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=1000, bias=True)
#     ) 
# 
# To use the model with our dataset we reinitialize this layer as
# 
# ::
# 
#    model.classifier[6] = nn.Linear(4096,num_classes)
# 
# VGG
# ~~~
# 
# VGG was introduced in the paper `Very Deep Convolutional Networks for
# Large-Scale Image Recognition <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf>`__.
# Torchvision offers eight versions of VGG with various lengths and some
# that have batch normalizations layers. Here we use VGG-11 with batch
# normalization. The output layer is similar to Alexnet, i.e.
# 
# ::
# 
#    (classifier): Sequential(
#        ...
#        (6): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=1000, bias=True)
#     )
# 
# Therefore, we use the same technique to modify the output layer
# 
# ::
# 
#    model.classifier[6] = nn.Linear(4096,num_classes)
# 
# Squeezenet
# ~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# The Squeeznet architecture is described in the paper `SqueezeNet:
# AlexNet-level accuracy with 50x fewer parameters and <0.5MB model
# size <https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07360>`__ and uses a different output
# structure than any of the other models shown here. Torchvision has two
# versions of Squeezenet, we use version 1.0. The output comes from a 1x1
# convolutional layer which is the 1st layer of the classifier:
# 
# ::
# 
#    (classifier): Sequential(
#        (0): Dropout(p=0.5)
#        (1): Conv2d(512, 1000, kernel_size=(1, 1), stride=(1, 1))
#        (2): ReLU(inplace)
#        (3): AvgPool2d(kernel_size=13, stride=1, padding=0)
#     ) 
# 
# To modify the network, we reinitialize the Conv2d layer to have an
# output feature map of depth 2 as
# 
# ::
# 
#    model.classifier[1] = nn.Conv2d(512, num_classes, kernel_size=(1,1), stride=(1,1))
# 
# Densenet
# ~~~~~~~~
# 
# Densenet was introduced in the paper `Densely Connected Convolutional
# Networks <https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993>`__. Torchvision has four
# variants of Densenet but here we only use Densenet-121. The output layer
# is a linear layer with 1024 input features:
# 
# ::
# 
#    (classifier): Linear(in_features=1024, out_features=1000, bias=True) 
# 
# To reshape the network, we reinitialize the classifier’s linear layer as
# 
# ::
# 
#    model.classifier = nn.Linear(1024, num_classes)
# 
# Inception v3
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# Finally, Inception v3 was first described in `Rethinking the Inception
# Architecture for Computer
# Vision <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.00567v1.pdf>`__. This network is
# unique because it has two output layers when training. The second output
# is known as an auxiliary output and is contained in the AuxLogits part
# of the network. The primary output is a linear layer at the end of the
# network. Note, when testing we only consider the primary output. The
# auxiliary output and primary output of the loaded model are printed as:
# 
# ::
# 
#    (AuxLogits): InceptionAux(
#        ...
#        (fc): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=1000, bias=True)
#     )
#     ...
#    (fc): Linear(in_features=2048, out_features=1000, bias=True)
# 
# To finetune this model we must reshape both layers. This is accomplished
# with the following
# 
# ::
# 
#    model.AuxLogits.fc = nn.Linear(768, num_classes)
#    model.fc = nn.Linear(2048, num_classes)
# 
# Notice, many of the models have similar output structures, but each must
# be handled slightly differently. Also, check out the printed model
# architecture of the reshaped network and make sure the number of output
# features is the same as the number of classes in the dataset.

######################################################################
# Create the Optimizer
# --------------------
# 
# Now that the model structure is correct, the final step for finetuning
# and feature extracting is to create an optimizer that only updates the
# desired parameters. Recall that after loading the pretrained model, but
# before reshaping, if ``feature_extract=True`` we manually set all of the
# parameter’s ``.requires_grad`` attributes to False. Then the
# reinitialized layer’s parameters have ``.requires_grad=True`` by
# default. So now we know that *all parameters that have
# .requires_grad=True should be optimized.* Next, we make a list of such
# parameters and input this list to the SGD algorithm constructor.
# 
# To verify this, check out the printed parameters to learn. When
# finetuning, this list should be long and include all of the model
# parameters. However, when feature extracting this list should be short
# and only include the weights and biases of the reshaped layers.
# 

# Send the model to GPU
model_ft = model_ft.to(device)

# Gather the parameters to be optimized/updated in this run. If we are
#  finetuning we will be updating all parameters. However, if we are 
#  doing feature extract method, we will only update the parameters
#  that we have just initialized, i.e. the parameters with requires_grad
#  is True.

# Run Training and Validation Step
# --------------------------------

# Finally, the last step is to setup the loss for the model, then run the

# Also, the default learning rate is not optimal for all of the models, so

# Comparison with Model Trained from Scratch
# ------------------------------------------
# 
# Just for fun, lets see how the model learns if we do not use transfer
# learning. The performance of finetuning vs. feature extracting depends
# largely on the dataset but in general both transfer learning methods
# produce favorable results in terms of training time and overall accuracy
# versus a model trained from scratch.
# 

# Initialize the non-pretrained version of the model used for this run
scratch_model,_ = initialize_model(model_name, num_classes, feature_extract=False, use_pretrained=False)

# Final Thoughts and Where to Go Next
# -----------------------------------
# 
# Try running some of the other models and see how good the accuracy gets.
# Also, notice that feature extracting takes less time because in the
# backward pass we do not have to calculate most of the gradients. There
# are many places to go from here. You could:
# 
# -  Run this code with a harder dataset and see some more benefits of
#    transfer learning
# -  Using the methods described here, use transfer learning to update a
#    different model, perhaps in a new domain (i.e. NLP, audio, etc.)
# -  Once you are happy with a model, you can export it as an ONNX model,
#    or trace it using the hybrid frontend for more speed and optimization
#    opportunities.
