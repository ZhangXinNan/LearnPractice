# Generate a tree sample

Given training set of size $m$
```
For $b=1$ to $B$
    Use sampling with replacement to create a new training set of size $m$
    Train a decision tree on the new dataset.
```


# Randomizing the feature choice
At each node, when choose a feature to use to split, if n features are available, pick a random subset of k < n features and allow the algorithm to only choose from that subset of features.
