# Boosted trees intuition
增强树直觉

Given training set of size $m$
```
For $b=1$ to $B$
    Use sampling with replacement to create a new training set of size $m$
        But instead of picking from all examples with equal (1/m) probability, make it more likely to pick examples that the previously trained trees misclassify.
        但不是以相等（1/m）的概率从所有例子中进行选择，而是更有可能选择先前训练的树错误分类的例子。
    Train a decision tree on the new dataset.
```

# XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting)
- Open source implementation of boosted trees
- Fast efficient implementation
- Good choice of default splitting criteria and criteria for when to stop splitting
- Built in regularization to prevent overfitting
- Highly competitive algorithm for machine learning competitions (eg: Kaggle competitions)
